This project was made using this repository as a boilerplate: https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter, to avoid spending time setting up things up and focusing on the app development. Will later be substituted by a personal version of this boilerplate.

This project was made in order to complete a 3-part challenge:
  >1- Develop a StarWars web app, listing any of the SWAPI data with the possibility to see the details of the chosen data, and the possibility to read the details' details too. (done) <br />
  >2- Allow the user to make a search by text input. (done) <br />
  >3- Include a filter in the search (done)
  
Technologies used in the development:
  >basic html/css to give our app a basic (and for now ugly) interface <br />
  >react.js to effectively building the app <br />
  >ES6/babel <br />
  >webpack <br />
  
To-do list:
  >Adjust the filter tool, making the search update as soon as the filter parameters are changed <br />
  >Refactor the whole project, making my own react.js boilerplate <br />
  >Conclude the documentation, as for now all we have is comments about the main functions, it's parameters and returns. <br />
